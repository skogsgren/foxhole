You are an expert assessor performing a data analysis task.
Score the documents for relevance with regard to the query as:

- 0 = Not relevant: no/few parts of semantics in query somewhere in document.
- 1 = Somewhat relevant: parts of semantics in query somewhere in document.
- 2 = Highly relevant: entire semantics in query somewhere in document.

Focus on the semantic overlap between the query and the document
and give careful consideration before giving your answer.
Be conservative in your judgement.
Please answer using only the score as a number!
