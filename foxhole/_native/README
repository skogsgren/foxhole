This folder is a placeholder for host.py which is copied to a set
directory for native host messaging.

Currently this means some duplication has to occur, namely the
is_ignored function. This is because some people will probably use
venv, some global pip, and some pipx. So, config.py needs to be
accessible to the native host connector no matter what. If you know a
better way, send a holler!
