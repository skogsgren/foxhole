One popular and effective technique for text classification is the Naive Bayes / Bag of Words approach. In this blog post, we will delve into the technical details of this approach and explore specific examples to understand its workings.\n\nIntroduction to Naive Bayes\n\nNaive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem with the assumption of independence between features. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes has been widely used in various applications, including spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document classification.\n\nThe core idea behind Naive Bayes is to calculate the probability of a document belonging to a particular class given its feature values. In the context of text classification, features are typically the words present in the document. By applying Bayes’ theorem, we can compute the posterior probability of a class given a document:\n\nP(Class | Document) = (P(Document | Class) * P(Class)) / P(Document)\nBag of Words Representation\n\nThe Bag of Words (BoW) representation is a simple and effective way to convert textual data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. In the BoW model, a document is represented as an unordered collection of words, disregarding grammar and word order. Let’s understand this with an example.\n\nConsider the following three sentences:\n\n“I love cats.”\n“Dogs are adorable.”\n“Cats and dogs are good companions.”\n\nTo create the BoW representation, we first construct a vocabulary consisting of all unique words across the documents: “I,” “love,” “cats,” “dogs,” “are,” “adorable,” “and,” “good,” “companions.”\n\nNext, we create a feature vector for each document, where each element represents the count or presence of a word in the vocabulary. For instance, the BoW representation of the first sentence would be [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] since it contains “I,” “love,” and “cats,” but not the other words.\n\nApplying Naive Bayes on Bag of Words\n\nTo classify a new document using the Naive Bayes approach, we calculate the posterior probability for each class and assign the document to the class with the highest probability. To compute the likelihood of a document given a class, we make the assumption of feature independence, which simplifies the calculation.\n\nLet’s illustrate this with a practical example of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative. We have a dataset of labeled movie reviews, and we want to build a classifier using the Naive Bayes / Bag of Words approach.\n\nSuppose we have the following training data:\n\nWe preprocess the text by tokenizing it into words and creating a vocabulary: [“the,” “movie,” “was,” “amazing,” “I,” “didn’t,” “like,” “film,” “great,” “acting,” “and,” “an,” “engaging,” “plot,” “terrible,” “would,” “not,” “recommend,” “it,” “to,” “anyone”].\n\nNext, we construct the BoW representation for each review:\n\nNow, let’s assume we have a new movie review: “The acting was superb!” We can convert this review into its BoW representation: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTo classify this review, we calculate the posterior probability for each class using Naive Bayes. We estimate the class prior probabilities based on the training data and calculate the likelihood of the BoW representation given each class. Finally, we normalize the probabilities to obtain the posterior probabilities.\n\nLet’s assume we obtain the following probabilities:\n\nBased on these calculations, we can conclude that the new review is more likely to belong to the positive class. Thus, we classify it as a positive review.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Naive Bayes / Bag of Words approach is a powerful technique for text classification. It combines the simplicity of the BoW representation with the probabilistic reasoning of Naive Bayes to categorize text documents effectively. By treating words as independent features, Naive Bayes provides a computationally efficient and scalable solution for various NLP tasks.\n\nIn this blog post, we explored the technical details of the Naive Bayes / Bag of Words approach and demonstrated its application in classifying movie reviews. Understanding this technique equips us with a valuable tool for tackling text classification challenges and extracting insights from large volumes of textual data.\n\n--\n\nWritten by Anote\n42 followers\n·\n3 following\n\nGeneral Purpose Artificial Intelligence.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.\nFind sources: \"Sequence labeling\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (November 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nIn machine learning, sequence labeling is a type of pattern recognition task that involves the algorithmic assignment of a categorical label to each member of a sequence of observed values. A common example of a sequence labeling task is part of speech tagging, which seeks to assign a part of speech to each word in an input sentence or document. Sequence labeling can be treated as a set of independent classification tasks, one per member of the sequence. However, accuracy is generally improved by making the optimal label for a given element dependent on the choices of nearby elements, using special algorithms to choose the globally best set of labels for the entire sequence at once.\n\nAs an example of why finding the globally best label sequence might produce better results than labeling one item at a time, consider the part-of-speech tagging task just described. Frequently, many words are members of multiple parts of speech, and the correct label of such a word can often be deduced from the correct label of the word to the immediate left or right. For example, the word \"sets\" can be either a noun or verb. In a phrase like \"he sets the books down\", the word \"he\" is unambiguously a pronoun, and \"the\" unambiguously a determiner, and using either of these labels, \"sets\" can be deduced to be a verb, since nouns very rarely follow pronouns and are less likely to precede determiners than verbs are. But in other cases, only one of the adjacent words is similarly helpful. In \"he sets and then knocks over the table\", only the word \"he\" to the left is helpful (cf. \"...picks up the sets and then knocks over...\"). Conversely, in \"... and also sets the table\" only the word \"the\" to the right is helpful (cf. \"... and also sets of books were ...\"). An algorithm that proceeds from left to right, labeling one word at a time, can only use the tags of left-adjacent words and might fail in the second example above; vice versa for an algorithm that proceeds from right to left.\n\nMost sequence labeling algorithms are probabilistic in nature, relying on statistical inference to find the best sequence. The most common statistical models in use for sequence labeling make a Markov assumption, i.e. that the choice of label for a particular word is directly dependent only on the immediately adjacent labels; hence the set of labels forms a Markov chain. This leads naturally to the hidden Markov model (HMM), one of the most common statistical models used for sequence labeling. Other common models in use are the maximum entropy Markov model and conditional random field.\n\nSee also[edit]\nArtificial intelligence\nBayesian networks (of which HMMs are an example)\nClassification (machine learning)\nLinear dynamical system, which applies to tasks where the \"label\" is actually a real number\nMachine learning\nPattern recognition\nSequence mining\nReferences[edit]\nFurther reading[edit]\nErdogan H., [1]. \"Sequence labeling: generative and discriminative approaches, hidden Markov models, conditional random fields and structured SVMs,\" ICMLA 2010 tutorial, Bethesda, MD (2010)\nCategory: Machine learning\nThis page was last edited on 27 December 2020, at 13:06 (UTC).\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License; additional terms may apply.

In this article, we will discuss Python Generics with code examples.\n\nWhat are Python Generics?\n\nPython generics are like hints in Python. They came out in Python 3.5 and newer versions. They let you say what type of things your variables, functions, and results are. It helps you write down what kind of things your code is dealing with, but it doesn't make the computer check it while running the code. This makes your code easier to read and work with, especially when you are working on big projects or with other people.\n\nPython Generics Example\n\nBelow, are examples of Python Generics in Python.\n\nExample 1: Python Generics with Function\n\nIn this example, the below code defines a generic function element that retrieves the first element from a list of any type. It employs Python's TypeVar to denote the placeholder type T. The function is demonstrated with integer and string lists, printing their respective first elements.\n\nfrom typing import TypeVar, List\n\nT = TypeVar('T')\n\ndef element(items: List[T]) -> T:\n    return items[0]\n\n# Usage\nprint(element([1, 2, 3])) \nprint(element(['a', 'b', 'c']))  \n\n\nOutput\n\n1\na\nExample 2: Python Generics with Different Data Types\n\nIn this example, below code define a generic function combine that concatenates two different data types T and U into a string. It offers flexibility for combining diverse data types while ensuring type safety. Examples showcase combining integers and strings, with concatenated strings\n\nfrom typing import TypeVar\n\nT = TypeVar('T')\nU = TypeVar('U')\n\ndef combine(a: T, b: U) -> str:\n    return str(a) + str(b)\n\n# Usage\nprint(combine(10, 20)) \nprint(combine('hello', 2020)) \n\n\nOutput\n\n1020\nhello2020\nExample 3: Python Generics with Class\n\nIn this example, code defines a generic class Container using TypeVar and Generic, allowing it to hold any type of content. Instances container_int and container_str are created, holding an integer and a string respectively, and their content is retrieved using the retrieve_content method.\n\nfrom typing import TypeVar, Generic\n\nT = TypeVar(Generic[T])\n\nclass Container:\n    def __init__(self, content: T):\n        self.content = content\n    \n    def retrieve_content(self) -> T:\n        return self.content\n\n# Usage\ncontainer_int = Container(10)\ncontainer_str = Container('GeeksforGeeks')\n\nprint(container_int.retrieve_content()) \nprint(container_str.retrieve_content())  \n\n\nOutput\n\n10\nGeeksforGeeks\nPython Generics with Duck Typing\n\nDuck typing and Python generics are two different concepts, but they can be related in how they allow for flexible and dynamic programming in Python.\n\nFor know More about Duck Typing Click Here\n\nNow, let's see how these two concepts can be related with an example:\n\nPython does not have the concept of generics before Python3.5, however you might argue that every function is generic because the parameters are not typed. This is a duck typing approach, which means that anything that walks and quacks like a duck is regarded as such. So, normally, \"generic\" functions would just verify if the parameters or objects had the bare minimum of required properties and then handle the data accordingly.\n\nExample : In below code, Python generics enable type constraints for functions like process_data, ensuring that inputs conform to expected types; meanwhile, duck typing allows objects to be treated as the required type based on their behavior, irrespective of their explicit type, as demonstrated in process_data's dynamic handling of objects with a quack method.\n\nfrom typing import TypeVar, Iterable\n\n# Declare type variable\nT = TypeVar('T')  \n\ndef process_data(data: Iterable[T]) -> None:\n    for item in data:\n        # Check if the object has a quack method, then call it\n        if hasattr(item, 'quack') and callable(item.quack):\n            item.quack()\n        else:\n            print(f\"This object of type {type(item).__name__} doesn't quack like a duck!\")\n\n# Example class\nclass Duck:\n    def quack(self):\n        print(\"Quack!\")\n\n# Another class with similar behavior\nclass AnotherBird:\n    def quack(self):\n        print(\"Quack!\")\n\n# Using duck typing with process_data function\nduck_obj = Duck()\nanother_bird_obj = AnotherBird()\n\n# Both objects \"quack\" like a duck\nduck_list = [duck_obj, another_bird_obj]  \n\n# We can pass duck_list to process_data because both objects have a quack method\nprocess_data(duck_list)  \n\n\nOutput\n\nQuack!\nQuack!\n\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article \nPython Docstrings\nSimilar Reads\nPython 3 basics\nPython was developed by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s and its latest version is 3.11.0, we can simply call it Python3.
